# About Task Tracker

This is my first attempt at building with Vue.js. Figured it's about time to get into a frontend framework. It's somewhat of a to do list, with CRUD capabilities
and double clicking to set a highlight as a reminder.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
