## About Task Tracker

This is my first dive into <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html">Vue.js</a>. I followed along a intro tutorial done by Brad Traversy of <a href="https://www.traversymedia.com/">Traversy Media</a>. I've followed and gotten into a few of his guides to use as stepping stones.

A to do list of sorts. You can:

- add a task
- update a task
- delete a task
- and set or remove a reminder on a task by double clicking

This is not hosted anywhere yet. Only the source code here is available.
